#### Hi everyone,  👋

When I was younger, I used to imagined me working as a scientist wearing a white coat inside a laboratory but everything change when I fell in love with programming and financial maths at the beginning of college.

⚡ Fun fact: Currently, I'm working as a Data Scientist! 🤓

Now, I have a degree on Actuarial Sciences from the Science Campus at UNAM, I strongly believe this gave me a solid math education and improved my logical thinking through academic projects using stats, demography and solving problems algorithms.

Although my work experience has been a short time, I have already realised data anaysis has uncountable ways to benefit any kind of organization to improve their performance. For this reason, I strongly decided to learn as much as posible about Data Science 💗 and how it could be used to make a more equity world through data driven desitions.
